# Calc_0.4
The calculator app I programmed in Python - my first program, actually.

Pretty simple - just an arithmetic calculator that can support an arbitrary number of variables in its operations. Planning to continue 
modifying it over time, into more of a graphing calculator, to practice my skills in Python.
